## Projects

1. **Blackjack Optimal Strategy**  
   **Description:** Developed a full decision‐analysis model for blackjack by constructing Markov‐chain transition matrices for each player hand (hard, soft, and pairs) against every dealer up-card. Computed expected values (EV) for hit/stand/double/split actions using conditional probability, and implemented a dynamic programming algorithm to derive the optimal strategy.  
   **Tools/Techniques:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), dynamic programming, conditional probability, Markov chain modeling.

2. **Lotka-Volterra Competition**  
   **Description:** Formulated and analyzed the classical two-species competition model under shared resource limitation.  Starting from logistic growth, I derived the coupled ODEs, performed nondimensionalization to minimize parameters, identified nullclines and equilibrium points, and conducted stability and phase-plane analyses to explore coexistence versus exclusion regimes.  
   **Tools/Techniques:** Mathematica for symbolic derivations and phase-portrait plotting; Python (SciPy, Matplotlib) and MATLAB for numerical simulations and visualization.

3. **Luo-Rudy Cardiac Cell Model**  
   **Description:**  Used the Luo–Rudy model to explore how heart cells create and pass along electrical signals. I treated the cell membrane like an electric circuit with a capacitor and gates that open for ions, then wrote linked equations to track voltage and gate changes over time. Next, I built a line of connected cells to see how the signal travels down the fiber. I ran simulations that step through time for each cell and across space for the fiber to follow the wave. Finally, I tested how different potassium levels outside the cells and the strength of connections between cells affect the shape and speed of the electrical wave.   
  **Tools/Techniques:** MATLAB (ODE/PDE solver & visualization), PowerPoint

4. **Magic Square Construction via Operations Research**   
**Description:** Modeled the *n×n* magic square as a combinatorial optimization problem by assigning each cell xᵢⱼ an integer decision variable and enforcing row, column, and diagonal sum constraints, along with all-different conditions. Used a CP-SAT integer-programming solver to generate classical Lo-Shu (3×3) magic squares and extended the framework to construct orthogonal Latin squares for error-correcting codes.  
**Tools/Techniques:** Excel, integer programming, combinatorial optimization.

5. **European Option Pricing via Stochastic Processes**  
**Description:** Derived and implemented the Black–Scholes equation for European call and put options, and compared the analytical pricing formulas to simulated price paths generated by discrete random walks and continuous geometric Brownian motion. I used Mathematica for symbolic derivation and validation of the Black–Scholes formula, R to simulate stock trajectories and analyze the impact of volatility and time to expiration, and Excel for data preparation and summary tables.  
**Tools/Techniques:** Mathematica, R (tidyverse, ggplot2), Excel.
