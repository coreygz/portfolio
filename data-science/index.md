## Projects

1. **Burnt Pancake Solver**  
   **Description:** I solved the burnt pancake puzzle of sorting four pancakes by size and ensuring each burnt side faces down. I implemented a `flip(state, k)` routine in Python and applied breadth first search and A star search with a custom heuristic to find the optimal flip sequence.  
   **Tools and Techniques:** Python, BFS, A star

2. **Q Learning Pathfinding Agent**  
   **Description:** I built a Q learning agent on a 4×4 grid with goal, forbidden, and wall squares. Using an ε-greedy policy, the agent updates Q-values with a learning rate and discount factor to learn the optimal action in each square.  
   **Tools and Techniques:** Python, Q learning
