## Projects

1. **European Option Pricing via Stochastic Processes**  
   **Description:** Derived and implemented the Black–Scholes equation for European call and put options. I compared the analytic pricing formulas with simulated price paths generated by discrete random walks and continuous geometric Brownian motion.  
   **Tools/Techniques:** Mathematica, R, Excel

2. **Burnt Pancake Solver**  
   **Description:** Solved the burnt pancake puzzle of sorting four pancakes by size and burnt-side orientation. I wrote a flip routine and applied breadth-first search and A-star search with a custom state-distance heuristic.  
   **Tools/Techniques:** Python, search algorithms
