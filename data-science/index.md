## Projects

1. **European Option Pricing via Stochastic Processes**  
   **Description:** Derived and implemented the Black–Scholes equation for European options, compared analytic prices to simulated paths, and explored how volatility and time-to-expiration affect payoffs. Used Mathematica for symbolic derivation, R for simulations, and Excel for data prep.  
   **Tools:** Mathematica, R, Excel

2. **Burnt Pancake Solver**  
   **Description:** Solved the “burnt pancake” puzzle—sorting four pancakes by size and burnt side—using BFS and A* search. Implemented a `flip(state,k)` routine that reverses and flips the top k pancakes, and a heuristic for A* based on “largest pancake out of place.”  
   **Tools:** Python (plain), custom heuristic, A* & BFS
